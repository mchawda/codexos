What’s great

Clear positioning + scope: agent OS, visual flow editor, RAG, multi-tenant, monitoring. The README already sells the “autonomous engineering OS” idea and shows an opinionated stack. 
GitHub

Monorepo + pnpm + turbo: good base for speed and shared packages (agent-engine, rag-engine, toolkit, ui). 
GitHub

Ops story included: Docker/Docker Compose, Nginx reverse proxy, Prometheus + Grafana mentioned. This is rare at v1. 
GitHub

Red flags / gaps to close

Secrets hygiene
The repo lists .env.local and an env.production.example. Track only *.example; ensure .env* are ignored and use a secrets manager (SOPS/age, Doppler, AWS Secrets Manager) in CI/CD. 
GitHub

Security claims vs code
README promises AES-256-GCM vault, RBAC (6 roles), MFA/TOTP, SSO, audit logging. Great—but I can’t verify implementations yet. Add a /security/ spec + tests (KATs for crypto, role matrix, audit log invariants). 
GitHub

CI quality gates
I don’t see workflows exposed in the UI. Add GitHub Actions for: lint (ESLint, ruff), typecheck (tsc, mypy), unit tests (vitest/jest, pytest), build, Docker image scan (Trivy), SBOM (Syft), and license checks.

DB + migrations
README references Postgres URL, ChromaDB, but no visible migrations policy. Add Alembic (backend) and a reproducible make db (seed, migrate). 
GitHub

Compose hardening
Add healthcheck, restart: unless-stopped, read_only: true where possible, resource limits, network isolation, and explicit volume strategies. (A small sample below in “Quick fixes”.)

Backpressure & isolation for agent runs
Document a job queue (RQ/Arq/Celery/Temporal) and per-tenant quotas/timeouts to prevent noisy-neighbor effects.

Observability wiring
You mention Prometheus + Grafana—ship a ready-to-run dashboard pack + default metrics (agent run latency, token usage, queue depth). 
GitHub

Proprietary license
README states “LicenseRef-NIA-Proprietary”. Add a clear LICENSE.md body + NOTICE, and embed the SPDX header in source files via pre-commit. 
GitHub

RAG safety
Define per-tenant index namespaces, redaction policies, and memory ceilings; add evals (Faithfulness/Context-Recall) to prevent over-ingestion and data bleed.

Marketplace guardrails
If you’ll run third-party agents, you’ll need sandboxing (Firecracker/NSJail), signed bundles, capability tokens, and revenue share logic.

Top 10 quick fixes (can do this week)

Secrets: remove any committed .env.local; keep env.*.example. Add .gitignore rules for .env*.

Pre-commit: black, ruff, mypy, eslint --max-warnings=0, tsc --noEmit, commitlint.

GitHub Actions: build & test matrix (Node 18/20, Py 3.11/3.12), Docker build, Trivy scan, SBOM upload, release tags.

Compose health (snippet): yaml file


services:
  backend:
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -fsS http://localhost:8001/health || exit 1"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 10
    restart: unless-stopped
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "1.0"
          memory: 1G

DB migrations: add Alembic + alembic upgrade head in entrypoint; include seed scripts.

Auth rigor: rotate JWT signing keys per env; short access tokens + refresh flow; verify MFA enrollment paths and backup codes.

RBAC matrix: codify roles/permissions as data; generate docs from source; unit tests that forbid privilege escalation.

Audit log: append-only store with hash-chain + time source; log access to secrets, runs, exports; export to SIEM.

Agent runtime: brokered queue (Redis/Rabbit/Kafka) + idempotent run IDs; exponential backoff; circuit breaker on external LLMs.

Docs: add /docs/architecture.md, /docs/threat-model.md, /docs/runbooks/, /docs/tenancy.md. Link them from README.

“Make it crazy cool” roadmap (the fun bits)

Live Flow Debugger: time-travel timeline of an agent run (inputs, tool calls, token counts, costs) with step-through replay and “fork run” to tweak a node and re-execute.

Agent Manifests: signed agent.yaml (capabilities, tools, scopes, data entitlements, model budget). One-click deploy with policy checks.

Deterministic sandboxes: run tools in micro-VMs (Firecracker) with network egress policies; record syscalls as provenance.

Policy engine: OPA/Rego policies for “which agent can read which dataset/tool,” evaluated at run-time.

Eval-as-a-Service: built-in eval harness (faithfulness, toxicity, PII leaks, jailbreak score) before an agent is publishable in the marketplace.

Cost Guard: per-tenant rolling token budget with soft/hard caps, and automatic model downgrades when nearing limits.

Reproducible RAG: content addressing of chunks (Merkle roots) and signed retrieval manifests—great for enterprise trust.

First-class Plugins: SDKs for Tool/Node authors (TypeScript & Python) with typed templates and scaffolds.

Small README tweaks to increase conversions

Add stack badges + quick GIF of the visual flow editor.

Inline architecture diagram (the tree is good; a diagram is better). 
GitHub

Move Quick Start above Features; keep “Docker up in 60s” ultra-simple. 
GitHub

Add “Try it” section with default credentials only for local dev and a list of URLs (Web, FastAPI docs, Grafana).
