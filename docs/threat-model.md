# CodexOS Threat Model

## Overview

This document outlines the security threats, attack vectors, and mitigation strategies for the CodexOS autonomous engineering operating system. The threat model follows the STRIDE methodology and provides a comprehensive security analysis.

## Threat Categories (STRIDE)

### 1. Spoofing (Identity)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA/TOTP)
- Strong password policies and complexity requirements
- JWT token rotation and short expiration times
- API key management with proper scoping
- DNS security extensions (DNSSEC)
- Certificate pinning for critical endpoints

**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Priority**: P0 (Immediate)

### 2. Tampering (Data Integrity)

**Threat Description**: Unauthorized modification of data, code, or configuration.

**Attack Vectors**:

### 6. Elevation of Privilege

**Threat Description**: Attackers gaining unauthorized access to higher privilege levels.

**Attack Vectors**:

- **API Abuse**: Exploiting insufficient authorization checks

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Principle of least privilege
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Regular privilege audits and reviews
