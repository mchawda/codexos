# 🧠 CodexOS: Technical Blueprint

> "The Command Center for Autonomous AI Engineering"
> _Built from scratch by Manish. Modular. Agentic. Beautiful. Powerful._

---

## ⚙️ Core Philosophy
- Build an **MCP-native AI agentic system** that can ingest, reason, and act across projects
- Prioritize modularity, security, speed, and elegance (UX + DevEx)
- Empower devs to spawn, compose, debug, and deploy autonomous AI agents
- Be future-proof: local-first, multi-agent, RAG-native, private LLM optional

---

## 📐 System Modules (v1.0)

### 1. UI/UX Layer
- **Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind + shadcn/ui**
- **Dynamic visual graph builder** (React Flow)
- Real-time chat/agent interface
- File/project viewer with tree structure
- Upload + context inspector sidebar
- Settings panel (model config, tool access, logs)

### 2. Agent Engine
- **Agent Orchestrator** (LangGraph-style runner)
  - Plan → Sub-agents → Tool use → Memory updates
  - Supports chain, parallel, and conditional flows
- **Tool Loader**
  - Static tools (Shell, Web, Codegen, Python Exec)
  - LangChain / OpenAPI / Custom Python tools
  - Auto-discovered from `/tools` folder
- **Sub-Agent Builder**
  - Metadata + prompts + context + tools
  - Versioned + reusable
- **Self-feedback loop** (Reflection node)

### 3. RAG Engine
- Chunking pipelines: markdown, code, PDF, JSON, HTML
- **Vector DB**: Chroma or Qdrant
- Reranker: Cohere re-rank or handcrafted scoring
- Real-time ingest from:
  - Uploaded docs
  - GitHub repo
  - Dev folder (hot-reload via FS watch)
- Version-aware chunking (commit-aware tagging)

### 4. Project Context + Vault
- File explorer (tree + open file preview)
- Embed project metadata as context
- Local-first or Supabase Postgres
- **Encrypted Vault** for:
  - API keys
  - Model secrets
  - Tool credentials

### 5. Execution Environment
- **FastAPI agent backend**
  - Agent execution, RAG query, context merge
  - WebSocket + REST
- LLM Router:
  - OpenAI, Mistral, Claude, Llama.cpp, vLLM
  - Auto-model fallback and batching
- **RunPod container support** for agents
- Local eval mode with Docker or Poetry

### 6. Auth & Permissions
- Supabase or Clerk for multi-user auth
- Admin/Creator vs Executor/Viewer roles
- Share links + flow fork system

### 7. Marketplace (MVP)
- Share agents (name, desc, metadata, flow file)
- Fork and remix
- Optional: template import into projects

---

## 🧪 Advanced Features (Post-MVP)
- Auto-deploy to Replit/Cloudflare worker (one-click)
- GitHub Actions integration (agent as CI)
- Internal analytics dashboard (LangFuse, custom)
- Built-in terminal with agent memory
- Diff-aware regeneration (code diff aware agents)
- Live session replay (full trace replay)
- Collaboration (multi-user editing + agent session sharing)

---

## 🔐 Security / Quantum-Ready Extensions
- Local-only mode (airgapped devs)
- All keys vault-encrypted
- Optional PQC certs for secure transmission (Kyber/Dilithium)
- Add HSM or SPHINCS+ for agent signing (future)

## ⏱ Sprint Plan (Aggressive Timeline)

### Day 1
- [ ] Set up monorepo + boilerplate
- [ ] Build agent orchestrator + tool runner
- [ ] Basic agent CLI + test tools
- [ ] Build file/project ingestion pipeline

### Day 2
- [ ] UI: agent flow builder + chat window
- [ ] FastAPI agent executor + WebSocket
- [ ] RAG integration into agent calls
- [ ] API key vault system
- [ ] Basic marketplace (static templates)

## 🧠 What This Becomes
> Not just a tool — a **DevOps OS for agent-powered software engineering**

You're not making a wrapper. You're making the platform people use to **build wrappers, copilots, and autonomous engineering agents**. 

This is your VS Code for agent systems. The GitHub of flows. The OS for autonomous dev teams.
